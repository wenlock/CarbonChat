"* Emission estimates are based on energy consumption data from EIA's State Energy Consumption, Price, and Expenditure Estimates (SEDS) released Summer 2019
Available online at: http://www.eia.gov/state/seds/seds-data-complete.cfm?sid=US#CompleteDataFile
SEDS sources motor gasoline estimates from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). FHWA has revised its methods of estimating non-highway use of motor gasoline for year 2015 and 2016 data,
affecting how these data are allocated to each sector. While this revised methodology does not affect total petroleum consumed within SEDS, it does present compatibility issues with comparing 2015 and 2016 sectoral data
across the time-series. EPA will update the time-series data to be consistent with future revisions of SEDS and other relevant sources such as the U.S. national greenhouse gas inventory as updates become available
which address this issue. For more information, see:
